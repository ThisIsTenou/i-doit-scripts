##  Install i-doit on a GNU/Linux operating system

The script `idoit-install.sh` allows you to easily install the latest version of

*   i-doit pro or
*   i-doit open

on a fresh installation of a GNU/Linux operating system. Supported OSs are:

*   Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch"
*   Debian GNU/Linux 8 "Jessie"
*   Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS "Xenial"
*   Ubuntu Linux 16.10 "Yakkety"
*   Ubuntu Linux 17.04 "Zesty"

Before you execute this script you shouldâ€¦

*   Install one of the supported operating systems based on the [requirements mentioned in the i-doit knowledge base](https://kb.i-doit.com/display/en/System+Requirements)
*   Create a backup/snapshot of your system
*   Make sure that the system is allowed to access external Web services, for example package repositories and the i-doit website.

The "rest" can done by the script.

The script includes several steps which are all optional, but essential for running i-doit:

*   Install needed distribution packages
*   Configure PHP
*   Configure Apache Web server
*   Configure MariaDB DBMS
*   Download and install the latest version of i-doit pro or open

All steps are based on information provided by the [i-doit knowledge base](https://kb.i-doit.com/display/en/).

On a fresh installation download the script `idoit-install.sh` and execute it with super-user rights (`root`).

Download:

~~~ {.bash}
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bheisig/i-doit-scripts/master/idoit-install.sh
chmod 755 idoit-install.sh
~~~

Either run the script as `root`:

~~~ {.bash}
su
./idoit-install.sh
~~~

Or run it with `sudo` if available:

~~~ {.bash}
sudo ./idoit-install.sh
~~~

The script will ask you several questions. All of them have default answers. This allows you to just hit `ENTER` whenever a user interaction is needed.

Sometimes you need to restart your system so all changes take effect.

As `root`:

~~~ {.bash}
systemctl reboot
~~~

As non-`root`:

~~~ {.bash}
sudo systemctl reboot
~~~
