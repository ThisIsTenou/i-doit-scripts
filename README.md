*   Ubuntu Linux 16.10 "Yakkety"

*   CentOS 7.3

Before you execute this script you â€¦

*   Must install one of the supported operating systems in x86 64 bit based on the [requirements mentioned in the i-doit knowledge base](https://kb.i-doit.com/display/en/System+Requirements) (excluding the LAMP stack)
*   Should create a backup/snapshot of your system
*   Must make sure that the system is allowed to access external Web services, for example package repositories and the i-doit website.

The script includes several steps which are essential for i-doit:

*   Install needed distribution packages (LAMP stack)
*   Configure PHP
*   Configure Apache Web server
*   Configure MariaDB DBMS
*   Download and install the latest version of i-doit pro or open

All steps are based on information provided by the [i-doit knowledge base](https://kb.i-doit.com/display/en/).


### Usage

Connect to your freshly installed OS, for example via **SSH**. Download the script `idoit-install.sh` and execute it with super-user rights (`root`).

Download:

~~~ {.bash}
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bheisig/i-doit-scripts/master/idoit-install.sh
chmod 755 idoit-install.sh
~~~

Either run the script as `root`:

~~~ {.bash}
su
./idoit-install.sh
~~~

Or run it with `sudo` if available:

~~~ {.bash}
sudo ./idoit-install.sh
~~~

The script will ask you several questions. All of them have default answers. This allows you to just hit `ENTER` whenever a user interaction is needed.
